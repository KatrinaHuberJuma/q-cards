real MVP feature: 
use react
understand react router
use react bootstrap
- users can login as staff or students
- users can see cards holding student queue request
- users can see a form that posts info to the server
"students fill out forms with
    > desired outcome, 
    > current behavior, 
    > things I've tried, 
    > how I got here, 
    > other info
    and then it become a little card"
- bugs kill count

nice-to-haves:
- users can unfold chat/thread area and have detailed discussions
"and each card has an attached chat area that can unfold"
- users can tag cards
- maybe integrate with discord
- staff location/attention indicator (who's being seen presently)
- @ another staff for additional assistance
