## Real MVP feature: 
- use react
<!-- understand react router -->
- use react bootstrap / css grid / flexbox
## Detailed MVP features:
- [x] users can login as staff or students
    - [x] make mock login data
    - [x] server route
    - [x] make login form
    - [x] logic about what logged in users see
    - [x] hold staff/student in state in <Main />
- [x] users can see cards holding student queue request
- [x] cards can be dequeued -> sent to archive
- [x] users can see a form that posts info to the server
    - "students fill out forms with
    - [x] desired outcome, 
    - [x] current behavior, 
    - [x] things I've tried, 
    - [x] how I got here, 
    - [x] other info
    - and then it becomes a little card"
- [x] database
- [x] data model
- [x] routes to retrieve/update db
- [x] use ~~React's `session`~~ local storage to keep users login
    - [ ] debug staff not being re-staff-ed when pulling from local storage
- [ ] bug bounty *** FEATURED UP NEXT ***
    - [ ] keep track of who earns squyshes
        - [x] adjust model 
        - to consider: can their be many resucuers to a question (yes, this is handled by multiple appearances)
    - is the bounty per 
        - [ ] all time
        - [ ] cohort
        - [ ] week (unit?)
        - [ ] lab
    - place to display bounties (would this maybe be a new page so we can play with Router? maybe a leader board page and/or staff profiles?)
        - [x] personal count for signed in staff
        - [ ] all staff leaderboard
            - [ ] figure out router 
            - [ ] fetch all squysh data
        - [ ] staff profile
    - later: how do we handle bug squash assists?
- [ ] web sockets 
    - [ ] queue updates for all connected users when enqueuing/dequeuing occurs
    - [ ] comments are visible in real time
- [x] logout
- [ ] resolving queue questions
    - [x] MVP squyshing: dequeuing automatically resolves a queue question
    - [ ] improved squyshing: dequeuing prompts comments field? not automatically resolved?

## Refactorings
- conditional rendering with ternary expression
    - [x] in card
    - [x] in main
- [x] sort active and inactive cards on the backend (maybe still one route with url arg/options header?)
- [x] move fetching cards to own function (e.g. `updateCards`) and call from within `useEffect` in `Main`. then can call `updateCards` whenever the data should change 
    - [x] remove fetch function from `main.jsx` 
    - [ ] ...and into a helper file 
- [ ] `Queue` will perform active card fetch, `Archive` will fetch the inactive cards
- [?] put `makeCards()` of `Queue` and `Archive` into a useEffect to prevent infinite loops/slow downs
- [ ] investigate queue + archive order
- [ ] make a python-to-javascript variable name modifier

## Nice-to-haves:
- [ ] users can unfold chat/thread area and have detailed discussions
    - "and each card has an attached chat area that can unfold"
- [ ] users can tag cards
- [ ] maybe integrate with discord
- [ ] staff location/attention indicator (who's being seen presently)
- [ ] @ another staff for additional assistance
- [ ] cards should be draggable
- [x] use react to make modal with state
- [ ] create heap for priority
- [x] handle pair questions
- [x] cute empty queue gif (a beach?)
- [ ] htttpcats for http status codes
- [ ] add Save Our Queue timer that alerts staff if a question has been unaddressed for x amount of time
- [ ] create SomeChillComponent (reason tbd)
- [ ] staff away photos/statuses
- [ ] opt out of seeing bug bounty ranking
- [ ] update to new, sad version of sqlalchemy querying

## Explore:
- [x] Frodo API * Athelia solo quest -> boo, API is unhelpful
- [ ] CSS Flexbox
- [ ] React's version of `session`

## Code Review Questions:
- Should we be concerned about number of mountings?
- EnqueueForm line 8 - we wanted to make 1 piece of state to hold all the form 
data but ran into issues (we think) Is this possible? Or do we need to keep 
having bunches of pieces of state for each part of the form?

## Will not use (for this project):
- [ ] react router
