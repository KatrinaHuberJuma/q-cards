real MVP feature: 
use react
understand react router
use react bootstrap / css grid / flexbox
[ ] users can login as staff or students
[x] users can see cards holding student queue request
[x] users can see a form that posts info to the server

"students fill out forms with
    > desired outcome, 
    > current behavior, 
    > things I've tried, 
    > how I got here, 
    > other info
    and then it becomes a little card"
[ ] bugs kill count

nice-to-haves:
[ ] users can unfold chat/thread area and have detailed discussions
"and each card has an attached chat area that can unfold"
[ ] users can tag cards
[ ] maybe integrate with discord
[ ] staff location/attention indicator (who's being seen presently)
[ ] @ another staff for additional assistance
[ ] cards should be draggable
[-] use react to make modal with state
[ ] create JS queue class
[ ] create heap for priority
